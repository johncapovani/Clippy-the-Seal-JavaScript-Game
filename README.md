Summary:
This application is a browser game called Clippy the Seal. The game is inspired by the likes of Flappy Bird, the Google Chrome Offline Dinasour Game, and Pacman.

Using JavaScript, the game will render a background of tiles. With the tile grid, it will determine where the character (Clippy the Seal) will be placed, along with where the sharks should generate at random. The user will use the up and down arrows or space bar to navigate the playing field. The user also has the option to select the difficulty setting that he or she would like to play.

The objective of this game is to avoid being "clipped" by one of the sharks. Seals are fast-resilient animals and spend countless hours of their lives dodging shark attacks. Let's see how long the user can avoid being clipped...
