Summary:
This application is a browser game called Clippy the Seal. The game is inspired by the likes of Flappy Bird, the Google Chrome Offline Dinasour Game, and Pacman.

Using JavaScript, the game will render a background of tiles. With the tile grid, it will determine where the character (Clippy the Seal) will be placed, along with where the sharks should generate at random. The user will use the up and down arrows or space bar to navigate the playing field. The user also has the option to select the difficulty setting that he or she would like to play.

The objective of this game is to avoid being "clipped" by one of the sharks. Seals are fast-resilient animals and spend countless hours of their lives dodging shark attacks. Let's see how long the user can avoid being clipped...

Development Notes / Thought process behind creating the application:

In order to create the HTML using DOM I watched multiple youtube videos, referenced W3 Schools, and other websites to learn.

For the movement and animation of the game I referenced this youtube video and modified the images, styling, and other functionality. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LprJOTU37hk

Main Takeaways: This activity was helpful in identifying the fundamentals that I do and do not grasp in regards to JavaScript. I plan on diving deeper into asyn await functions, canvas design, and classes.
